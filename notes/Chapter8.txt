formal parameter- the name you give a method when you define it
actual paramater- the name you give a method when you use it
BÃ¶hm and Jacopini- theoretical result that only sequence, selection, and pretest 
	logical loops are absolutely required to express computations 
block- a compound statement that can define a new scope
control statements- to make computations in programs flexible and powerful selecting among alternative 
	control flow paths and some means of causing the repeated execution of statements or sequencs of statements
control structure- control statement and collection of statements controlled
multiple-selection- allows the selection of one of any number of statements or groups
iterative statement- one that causes a statement or collection of statements to be executed
unconditional branch statement- transfers execution control to a specified location in a program
Counter-Controlled Loops- looop var can be integer real or double
	loop var always has its last value
	loop var cannot be change in the loop, only parameters because they are evaluated only once
logically-controlled loops- pretest or postest,some languages have one or both
Guarded commands- support a new programming metholodology
